Objects and its internal representation
 In JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type.
 These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types
 (Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol)
 in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each
 Objects are more complex and each object may contain
 any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
